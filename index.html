        <h3>Intern at Swecha AP</h3>
        <p>
          I've developed a stimulation based web app using basic web technologies like html, css, javascript.
          App development by me was used by students of govt schools to better understand their academics.<br>
          Through this internship, I've learned how to collaborate and work as a team.
          I've learned javascript, git, Agile Methodologies during the internship.<br>
          Swecha AP is a great organization, With the impact sessions conducted by Swecha, I've understood a lot about our society, it helped me grow as a person.
